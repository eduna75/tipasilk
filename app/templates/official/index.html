                            <p>Tipa silk comes from the Isaan part of Thailand.
                                The silk is produced by locals and hand woven into scarfs and fabrics that’s been used
                                to make the finest clothes.
                                Isaan is pronounced e- saan and is a big area of Thailand that’s connected to Cambodia
                                and Laos.

                                Normally the people from the villages are busy working on the rice fields as their daily
                                job.
                                But in between the planting and harvesting of the crops the ladies will be busy with
                                making silk.</p>

                            <p>Taking care of the silk worms and making the fine threats of yarn from which they will
                                make those beautiful fabrics and scarfs.

                                Tipasilk brings work to those women so they will have an extra income for their daily
                                needs.
                                Life in the villages is slow and not much has changed since 100 years ago.</p>
